# Please pardon me for the steps below â€“ I know they aren't perfect, but this is just for my reference to remind 
myself of the setup process.

1. Download and install Mingw for C/C++
2. Set Path variable
3. Download 
    SDL2 main: SDL2: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases
    SDL2_image: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases
    SDL2_mixer: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/releases
    SDL2_ttf: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases
4. Create a new project folder then code .
5. create main.c then choose terminal > configure build task and choose C/C++: gcc.exe
6. In the new project folder create src folder and then copy include and lib from SDL2 > x86_64-w64-mingw32.
Then copy the include and lib to the new src folder.
7. Copy the SDL2.dll from BIN into the root of new project directory.
8. To add SDL IMage and other extensions follow these step for each :
    ---include
    i. Open SDL_image folder locate x86_64-w64-mingw32 then copy the SDl_image.h to the include folder of our source folder.
    ---Lib
    ii. now from the cmake copy the SDL2_image folder to the cmake folder in the src folder.
    iii. copy the SDL2_image.pc to the pkconfig of the src.
    iv. now copy the remaining files which are not folder from the lib folder to the src lib folder.

    Repeat the above steps for other also.
9. Add code to the main.c and run using the following commands 
    ---C
    gcc -g -c main.c -I./src/Include -L./src/lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer -lSDL2
    gcc -g -o Game main.o -L./src/lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer -lSDL2
    ./Game.exe
    
    ---C++
    g++ -g -c main.cpp -I./src/Include -L./src/lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer -lSDL2
    g++ -g -o Game main.o -L./src/lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer -lSDL2
    ./Game.exe

10. Alternatively you can use a batch file to skip executing 3 commands each time, refer the batch file for code.
